=head1 NAME

roll - Command line interface for dice rolls

=head1 VERSION

version 0.044

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Evaluate these command line params
    roll 3d6 2d8

    echo "5d6" > f
    echo "2d4+1" >> f

    # Read the contents of 'f' from STDIN
    roll < f

    # Evaluate 1d100 and open file 'f'
    roll d% f

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a command line interface to the L<Games::Dice> library. It takes
die rolling specifications in the form of I<a>dI<b>[+-*/b]I<c>. 

(This specification may change a bit over time, but not radically.)

=over

=item *

I<a> is optional and defaults to 1; this is number of dice to roll. 

=item * 

I<b> is the number of sides on each die. '%' is shorthand for 100. 

=back

The optional end modifies the sum of the rolls. 'b' means take the 
"best" I<c> rolls and sum them. Also '/' truncates the result to
an integer after division.

Dice specifications can be piped in, given on STDIN or as positional 
parameters from the command line.

If a positional parameter matches a file name, it will be opened and 
each line of the file evaluated.
